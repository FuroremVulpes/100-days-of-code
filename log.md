# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on html structure and api parsing.

**Thoughts:** I tried to just focus on a basic structure of the app to not get stuck. This was great because I got most of the functionality working because I didn't focus that much on the design of the app. But I feel that I can
get a better structure of my js code.

### Day 2: October 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Weather App project

**Thoughts:** Learned how to fit and center a background image to the body with css. Havn't fixed the structure of the js code, but it works all fine for now.

### Day 3: October 5, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started on FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia Viewer project

**Thoughts:** Taking the approach of creating a jquery plugin this time. Feels like a better approach for this type of projects. Will se if I will return to the old projects and convert them to jquery plugins instead.

### Day 7: October 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continue on FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia Viewer project

### Day 8: October 10, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continue on FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia Viewer project

**Thoughts:** Tried to separate the search input and the result in two plugins. Having some truble with 'this'. When I am invoking the method to update the search result in my result plugin, 'this' is an instance of the search input plugin. Has to have something to do with that both are named 'Plugin' or something. Should look into that next time.

### Day 9: October 11, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continue on FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia Viewer project

**Thoughts:** Got the search functionality to work. I feel that it should be a better way to have the jQuery plugins subcribe and publish to events but my solutions was the best one I could come up with.

### Day 11: October 13, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started on FreeCodeCamp Twitch Streams project

**Thoughts:** This time I have taken the approach of not using bootstrap or jquery. The reason being I want to have clear understanding of CSS and a solid foundation of plain JavaScript. If I use something that I need to look more into while coding I will use a comment TOLEARN, so I know next time what I should look into.
