# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on html structure and api parsing.

**Thoughts:** I tried to just focus on a basic structure of the app to not get stuck. This was great because I got most of the functionality working because I didn't focus that much on the design of the app. But I feel that I can
get a better structure of my js code.

### Day 2: October 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Weather App project

**Thoughts:** Learned how to fit and center a background image to the body with css. Havn't fixed the structure of the js code, but it works all fine for now.
